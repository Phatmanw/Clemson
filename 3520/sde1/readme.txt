On my honor I have neither given nor received aid on this exam

wdlewis-sde1 contains three files; this file(readme.txt), nnr1.log which shows 2
sample uses of each of the required functions, and nnr1.caml.  nnr1.caml contains 
the five required functions:

printList(listoflists) - takes in a list of lists and prints out each list on a
separate line

theClass(vect) - returns the class (last number) of the vector passed in

distanceR2(v1, v2) - returns the Euclidean distance (squared) between the 
vectors passed into the function excluding the class

distanceAllVectors2(v, vset) - returns a list of distances from v to each member 
of vset

nnr(test,h) - returns the class of the 1-nearest neighbor of test in h using the
Euclidean (squared) distance measure.
